# Bubbles, the first frontier

## A simple version of Asteroids

## Motivation
This is my first game and interactive program. It was made while following along in the Build Asteroids course of [Boot.Dev](boot.dev). It is written in Python using the [pygame](https://www.pygame.org) library.

## Quick Start
### Requirements
Python 3.10+
Unix-like shell

### Create a virtual environment at the top level of the project directory
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```
### Activate the virtual environment
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Start the game (will open in a new window)
```bash
python3 main.py
```

### Controls
WASD to move, Spacebar to shoot
Avoid the bubbles and pop what you can

### When you are finished, deactivate the virtual environment
```bash
deactivate
```
